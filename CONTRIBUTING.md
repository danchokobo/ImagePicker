### Other information

GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback in **ImagePicker**. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ImagePicker), [FAQ](https://github.com/hyperoslo/ImagePicker/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/hyperoslo/ImagePicker/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
